Here are three ways to explain your project, depending on who you are talking to.

Option 1: The "One-Liner" (For casual conversation)
"I built PropertyHub, a full-stack web application that helps landlords manage their properties and tenants easily, replacing messy paperwork with a digital dashboard."

Option 2: The Professional Pitch (For Interviews & Recruiters)
"What is your project?" "My project is called PropertyHub. It is a comprehensive Property Management System designed to bridge the gap between landlords and tenants. It streamlines the entire rental process, from onboarding tenants to tracking monthly rent payments."

"What is the use?" "The main goal is to automate the daily tasks of property management. Usually, landlords track everything in Excel sheets or WhatsApp messages, which is chaotic. PropertyHub centralizes everything:

For Landlords: It gives a clear financial overview and helps manage maintenance issues efficiently.

For Tenants: It provides a professional portal to check their lease status, pay rent, and request repairs without endless phone calls."

Option 3: The Detailed Feature Breakdown
When they ask "What are the features?", you can list them like this:

🔐 1. Secure Authentication & Roles
Role-Based Access: The app distinguishes between Landlords and Tenants.

Security: Uses Spring Security and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure data is safe.

Smart Signup: Users can select their role (Landlord/Tenant) during registration.

🏠 2. Property & Tenant Management (Landlord View)
Dashboard: A visual overview of total income, pending rent, and occupancy rates (using charts).

Unit Management: Landlords can add, edit, or delete property listings with images and details.

Tenant Database: A directory to view tenant details and lease status.

🛠 3. Maintenance System
Issue Reporting: Tenants can submit maintenance requests (e.g., "Leaky faucet") directly through the app.

Status Tracking: Landlords can view these requests and mark them as "In Progress" or "Completed."

💳 4. Financials & Leases
Rent Tracking: Tracks who has paid and who is overdue.

Lease Management: Digital storage of lease agreements so both parties can view start/end dates.

💻 The Tech Stack (If they ask "How did you build it?")
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for animations).

Backend: Java Spring Boot, Spring Security.

Database: MySQL.

Tools: Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation.
